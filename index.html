    <p>Muhammad Atif Aslam is a Pakistani playback singer, songwriter, composer and actor who is best known for his
        songs in the Pakistani and Indian film industries.[1] He has recorded many songs in both Pakistan and India and
        is known for his vocal belting technique.[1][2]

        He predominantly sings in Urdu and often times in Hindi, but has also sung in Punjabi, Bengali and Pashto. With
        a number of successful songs, he is often considered one of the best playback singers in the Indian and
        Pakistani music industries of all times.[3][4][5] In 2008, Aslam received the Tamgha-e-Imtiaz, the
        fourth-highest civilian honour award from the Pakistani government. He is also a recipient of a number of Lux
        Style Awards.[6] Aslam made his acting debut in 2011 with the Urdu social drama film Bol. In 2019, he was
        awarded a star in the Dubai Walk of Fame after his nomination for the best singer in Pakistan.[7][8][9] He was
        also featured in the Forbes Asia's 100 Digital Stars, published in December, 2020.[10][11] He refers to his fans
        as "Aadeez" (Urdu: عادیز, lit. 'Habituals').[12]</p>

    <h2 id="Career">Career</h2>
    <p>Aslam has stated that he had no initial formal training in music, and was not interested in the thought of
        pursuing a musical career over one in cricket. It was not until his college days that he began to actively take
        part in various musical competitions and eventually was encouraged by his friends to establish himself in the
        music industry.[19] He has mentioned the works of Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan as one of his very first musical
        inspirations.[19]

        After separation from Jal, Aslam released his first album titled Jal Pari, on 17 July 2004, produced by Sarmad
        Abdul Ghafoor, having 11 tracks, which was an instant hit.[20][21]</p>

        including remix versions of both songs, all were composed by Pritam with lyrics by Irshad Kamil and Ashish
        Pandit, which fetched him several nominations.[24][25][26] He sang advertising Olper's Qawwali "Hum Mustafavi".
        In Coke Studio Season 2, his five songs were released titled as "Jal Pari", "Kinara" (co-sung by Riaz Ali Khan),
